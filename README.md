## ✧ Hey ✧

My name is Lumina.  
I'm a 19 y.o trans girl from Germany, trying to fit in this chaotic and yet so strangely beautiful world. 🌍🌃  
I'm currently in my third year of apprenticeship to become an **IT specialist for application development**.

I love building things that feel aesthetic🌌 and meaningful🗽.  
Right now I'm working on school projects🏫 and my own long-term ideas🧠.

My main languages & frameworks are **C#**, **.NET**, **ASP.NET Core**, and **Blazor**.

### ✧ About Me ✧
INFJ • 4w5 • Night Owl  
I enjoy deep conversations, quiet creativity, and building small but meaningful tools.

### ✧ What I’m Working On ✧
- **Lumify** — a CLI toolbox for Minecraft players
